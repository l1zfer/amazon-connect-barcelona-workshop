## Theme Detection and Conversational Analytics Rules
### Theme Detection
- By using theme detection, you can create more effective Conversational Analytics rules and address your customers' most pressing needs and concerns 
    - For instance, you can identify reasons for customers reaching out, such as "account termination" or "billing complications." 
    - Subsequently, you can undertake suitable measures to enhance the customer experience by accelerating issue resolution, refining IVR options, enriching knowledge base articles, and bolstering agent training
- To generate a themes report, you need to save a contact search within a specific time range. The search results must contain at least 300 contacts with issues detected by Contact Lens. Once these criteria are met, the "Generate themes report" button will become visible
### Rules creation
- Rules automatically perform specified tasks based on defined conditions
- Enables automatically categorizing contacts, send notifications, or create tasks depending on keywords used during calls or chats, sentiment analysis scores, customer details, and other parameters
- Found in the Analytics and Optimization sidebar menu, under Contact Lens
- **Conversational Analytics** rules are one of the 5 types of rules that can be created
    - Can be applied to both voice and chat conversations, either in real-time as the conversation occurs or afterward through post-conversation analysis

## Evaluation forms
- Part of the **Quality Management** systematic process
    - Range of activities, including monitoring and scoring customer interactions, providing feedback and coaching to representatives, analyzing performance metrics, and implementing continuous improvement strategies
- Relies on Rules set under Analytics and Optimization to assess the agent performance based on a predefined set of criteria (greeting, legal disclaimers, genuine rapport and empathy build-up, pace and clearly-spoken language, recapping the call summary upon completing the interaction, for instance)

## Calibration sessions
- Contact Lens enables conducting calibration sessions for performance evaluations to drive consistency and accuracy in how managers evaluate agent performance, so that agents receive feedback that is consistent
- The evaluation form must be used to create the calibration session
- Any user who has the permission to perform evaluations, namely **Evaluation forms - perform evaluations**, can participate in a calibration session when added as participants
- Analytics and optimzation > Contact search > select contact > Evaluations > Calibration session > Setup calibration session
- Evaluations can be visualized on Dashboards (Analytics and optimization > Dashboards and reports)
